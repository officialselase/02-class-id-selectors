# 02-class-id-selectors
Introduction
This exercise focuses on practicing the use of class and ID selectors in CSS. By completing this task, you'll understand how to apply styles to HTML elements using these selectors, differentiate when to use classes versus IDs, and practice combining multiple selectors for more specific styling.

Task Overview
You will:

Add class and id attributes to HTML elements as specified.
Write CSS rules using proper selector syntax.
Use non-keyword color values (RGB, HEX, or HSL) for styling.
Requirements
HTML Elements and Attributes
Add class attributes for elements that share common styles.
Add id attributes for elements that require unique styles.
CSS Styling
Odd-numbered elements:
Background: Light red/pink (#ffcccb)
Fonts: Verdana, DejaVu Sans, sans-serif
Second element:
Text color: Blue
Font size: 36px
Third element:
Combine styles for odd-numbered elements.
Font size: 24px
Fourth element:
Background: Light green (#ccffcc)
Font size: 24px
Font weight: Bold
Steps to Complete
Set up the HTML:

Create class and id attributes for the specified elements.
Link a CSS file to the HTML using the <link> tag.
Write CSS Rules:

Use class selectors (.classname) for reusable styles.
Use ID selectors (#idname) for unique styles.
Combine selectors (e.g., .class1.class2) for specific styling.
Test the Styling:

Open the HTML file in your browser to ensure the styles are correctly applied.
Use browser developer tools (Inspect) to debug if necessary.
Expected Outcome
By the end of this task:

You will have styled the elements according to the specifications.
You will understand the difference between classes and IDs and their proper use in CSS.
You will be familiar with combining multiple classes for targeted styling.
Self-Check
Did you use class and id attributes appropriately?
Did you write CSS rules using correct selector syntax?
Did you use a non-keyword color value for backgrounds (e.g., HEX or RGB)?
Did you inspect your work in a browser to confirm the styling?
